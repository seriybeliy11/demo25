To achieve the deployment of a MediaWiki application using Docker on the Second-SRV server, you can follow these steps. Below is a `wiki.yml` file that meets all the specified requirements:

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  wiki:
    image: mediawiki
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./LocalSettings.php:/var/www/html/LocalSettings.php
    depends_on:
      - mariadb

  mariadb:
    image: mariadb
    environment:
      MYSQL_DATABASE: mediawiki
      MYSQL_USER: wiki
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: WikiP@ssw0rd
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
    volumes:
      - mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  mariadb_data:
```

### Explanation:

1. **Version**: Specifies the version of the Docker Compose file format.
2. **Services**:
   - **wiki**:
     - Uses the `mediawiki` image.
     - Maps port `8080` on the host to port `80` in the container.
     - Mounts the `LocalSettings.php` file from the home directory into the container.
     - Depends on the `mariadb` service, ensuring the database is started before MediaWiki.
   - **mariadb**:
     - Uses the `mariadb` image.
     - Sets environment variables to create a database named `mediawiki`, a user `wiki` with password `WikiP@ssw0rd`, and a root password.
     - Mounts a volume for persistent storage of the database data.
3. **Volumes**: Defines a named volume `mariadb_data` for the MariaDB data.

### LocalSettings.php

Ensure you have a `LocalSettings.php` file in your home directory with the correct settings. Here is a basic example of what the file might look like:

```php
<?php
# This file was automatically generated by the MediaWiki installer.
# If you make manual changes, please keep track in a separate file.

wfLoadExtension( 'VisualEditor' );
wfLoadExtension( 'WikiEditor' );

$wgSitename = "MyWiki";
$wgEmergencyContact = "your-email@example.com";
$wgEnotifUserTalk = false; # UPO
$wgEnotifWatchlist = false; # UPO
$wgEnotifMinorEdits = false; # UPO
$wgEnotifUsesRealName = false; # UPO
$wgPasswordSender = "your-email@example.com";
$wgEnableUploads  = true;
$wgUseInstantCommons = false;

$wgDBtype = "mysql";
$wgDBserver = "mariadb";
$wgDBname = "mediawiki";
$wgDBuser = "wiki";
$wgDBpassword = "WikiP@ssw0rd";

$wgDBprefix = "";

$wgServer = "http://localhost:8080";
```

### Steps to Deploy:

1. **Create the `wiki.yml` File**: Save the above YAML content into a file named `wiki.yml` in the home directory of the user on the Second-SRV server.
2. **Create the `LocalSettings.php` File**: Save the above PHP content into a file named `LocalSettings.php` in the home directory of the user on the Second-SRV server.
3. **Run Docker Compose**: Navigate to the home directory and run the following command to start the services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose -f wiki.yml up -d
   ```

This will start the MediaWiki application and the MariaDB database, making MediaWiki accessible on port `8080`.
